= Problem statement =
Suppose you wish to conduct a survey of users on a private network that has no access to the network on which you intend to perform analysis of the survey results.

How would you collect data while trying to preserve the properties necessary for a successful survey? For instance,
* confidentiality - users can be confident their answers will be anonymized
* integrity - you can be confident the answers will not be modified by an unauthorized user
